# Graph 
# Fun1 (O(1)) → flat line (time does not increase with n).
# Fun2 (O(n)) → straight line increasing with n.
# Fun3 (O(n²)) → grows much faster (like a curve upwards).
        
# Summary of the 3 functions
# Fun1: O(1) → Best & Fastest (formula method).
# Fun2: O(n) → Medium (loop method).
# Fun3: O(n²) → Slowest (nested loops).        
        
# General Concepts (from your notes)
# Time Complexity = how long an algorithm takes (steps/iterations).
# Examples: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.                                  
# Space Complexity = how much extra memory it uses.
# Order of Growth = comparing which algorithm grows faster as n increases.
# Example: n² grows faster than n, so O(n²) is slower.  

# So in short:
# Fun1 is the most efficient (fastest).
# Fun2 is okay for small n.
# Fun3 is the slowest and should be avoided for large n.
